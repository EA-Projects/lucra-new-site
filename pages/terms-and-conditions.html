                        <p><strong>11.1	Definition of Confidential Information.</strong>  For the purposes hereof, “Confidential Information” means any and all non-public information of a Party, including, without limitation, (a) any information relating to a Party’s current and planned products and services, technology, techniques, know-how, research, engineering, designs, finances, accounts, procurement requirements, manufacturing, providers, provider lists, business forecasts, marketing, and/or other information that should by its nature be reasonably understood as confidential, (b) any other information of a Party that is conspicuously designated as “Confidential,” that is orally identified as “Confidential” at the time of disclosure, or that should reasonably be understood to be “Confidential” in view of the subject matter and circumstances of disclosure,  and (c) the terms and conditions of this Agreement (which shall be both Parties’ Confidential Information).   Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include information that (i) is or becomes publicly available through no act of the receiving Party in breach of this Agreement, (ii) was in the possession of the receiving Party prior to its disclosure or transfer hereunder as the receiving Party can reasonably demonstrate, (iii) is independently developed by the receiving Party without reference to the materials comprising the Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement, and/or (iv) is received from another source without any restriction on its use or disclosure. </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>11.2	Obligations.</strong>  The Party receiving Confidential Information disclosed by the other Party (“<strong>Recipient</strong>” and “<strong>Discloser</strong>,” respectively) shall use Discloser’s Confidential Information solely to perform its obligations and/or exercise its rights hereunder and not for any other purpose, including without limitation the purpose of competing with Discloser.  Recipient shall not disclose Discloser’s Confidential Information to any third party without Discloser’s prior written consent and shall protect Discloser’s Confidential Information against unauthorized use or disclosure using at least those measures that Recipient takes to protect its own Confidential Information of a similar nature, but in no event using less than reasonable care.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for the avoidance of doubt, the Parties understand and agree that Client may disclose Lucra’s Confidential Information to any Client Affiliate(s) and to its and their respective directors, officers, employees, and/or agents who have a bona fide need to know the information in order to administer this Agreement and/or manage the relationship between the Parties, provided that Client  shall ensure that such Client Affiliate(s) and directors, officers, employees, and/or agents comply with the provisions of this Section 11 and shall be responsible for any and all failures to do so.  Lucra shall disclose Client’s Confidential Information only to those of its personnel who have a bona fide need to know same solely for the purpose of and to the extent necessary for Lucra’s performance hereunder, provided that Lucra shall ensure that such personnel comply with the provisions of this Section 11 and shall be responsible for any and all failures to do so.  The foregoing obligations will not restrict either Party from disclosing the other Party’s Confidential Information (a) pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other Governmental Authority or as may be required by any law or regulation, provided that the Party required to make such a disclosure gives as much prior notice to the Discloser as is practicable under the circumstances to enable Discloser to contest such order or requirement at Discloser’s sole cost and expense, and (b) on a confidential basis to its legal or professional financial advisors.  The Parties agree that in the event of a breach of this Section 11, the non-breaching Party could suffer irreparable harm, that the total amount of monetary damages for any injury to the non-breaching Party may be difficult or impossible to ascertain, and that the non-breaching Party will thus be entitled to seek, without requirement of posting a bond, the temporary, preliminary and/or permanent injunctive relief against the breaching Party, its officers, and/or its employees, in addition to such other rights and remedies to which it may be entitled to at law or in equity.

The Parties do not intend hereunder to be joint controllers according to how that term is generally understood and used in accordance with Applicable Law pertaining to privacy and data security, and each Party has the right to act independently of the other pertaining to use of User Data, as well as User requests to handle such data (e.g., erasure requests, correction requests) (“<strong>User Data Requests</strong>”). During the Term, however, the Parties agree to cooperate in the communication to one another and the compliance with Applicable Laws regarding User Data Requests for the satisfaction of the User and for compliance reasons. During the Term, each Party shall use good industry practices to keep User Data secure. In the event of a Security Breach on either Party’s side, the other Party shall assist in taking any remedial action reasonably requested by the Party experiencing a Security Breach as provided below.

If Client objects to any provisions of these policies or terms, the Parties shall work in good faith to resolve the issues; provided that Lucra shall be permitted to implement without delay any such policy or terms of use in order to comply with Applicable Laws.  Such terms of use and privacy policy shall provide, as permitted by Applicable Law, for Client to assign, transfer, or otherwise permit Lucra to use such Lucra User Data consistent with this Section and any other provisions of this Agreement and, if requested by Lucra to comply with Applicable Law, Client shall make disclosures or obtain consent to assign, transfer, or otherwise permit Lucra to use User Data.

Immediately upon discovery or notification of a Security Breach, the Party whose systems were accessed in an unauthorized manner or whose employees were responsible for such Security Breach shall, at its own expense, investigate and take all steps to identify, prevent and mitigate the effects of any such Security Breach and bear all costs associated therewith, including remediating the issue and sending notices to consumers, regulatory fines or fees, and any legal fees or judgments.  Such Party shall promptly provide to the other Party a detailed description of the incident, the User Data accessed, and such other information as the other Party may request concerning the Security Breach and conduct any recovery necessary to remediate the impact of such Security Breach as required by applicable Law.  Each Party shall reasonably cooperate with the other Party in identifying any reasonable steps that should be implemented to limit, stop or otherwise remedy any actual or suspected Security Breach.

                            <strong>14.6	Force Majeure.</strong>  Any delay or failure by a Party hereto to perform its obligations hereunder will be excused if and to the extent caused by a Force Majeure.  A Party claiming Force Majeure must provide the other Party with written notice of such delay (including the anticipated duration of the delay) promptly after the occurrence of the Force Majeure.  For the purposes hereof, “Force Majeure” means an occurrence beyond a Party’s reasonable control and without its fault or negligence, including without limitation actions by any Governmental Authority (whether valid or invalid), fires, floods, windstorms, explosions, riots, natural disasters, other acts of nature, pandemic or public health emergency, wars, sabotage, and/or acts of terrorism.

No term of this Agreement shall be deemed waived except if and to the extent expressly specified in writing signed by the Party making such waiver.  A waiver by a Party of any breach of or default under this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any rights of a prior or subsequent default of the same or other provisions of this Agreement.  The failure or delay of a Party to enforce any of its rights shall not be deemed as a continuing waiver or a modification of this Agreement.

If negotiation does not result in a resolution within thirty (30) days of when one Party first notifies the other of the controversy or claim, then prior to initiating any legal proceeding, the Parties agree, understand, and acknowledge that (i) the Parties must first participate in mediation with an experienced third-party mediator mutually agreeable to the Parties; (ii) the Party desiring to initiate such action or proceeding must put the other Party on written notice of the dispute and the nature of such dispute; and (iii) the Parties must share equally in the costs of the mediation.  If mediation does not result in a resolution of the dispute, either Party may elect to pursue other legal proceedings.  EACH PARTY HERETO KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE TO DEMAND TRIAL BY JURY FOR ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, AND/OR COUNTER-CLAIM ARISING FROM AND/OR IN RELATION TO THIS AGREEMENT.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any actual or threatened breach of confidentiality, and/or misappropriation and/or infringement of the other Party’s Intellectual Property Rights by a Party, said Party acknowledges that the other Party may be caused to  experience irreparable injury for which monetary damages alone would not be sufficient and/or the extent of which may be difficult to ascertain and therefore agrees that the other Party shall be entitled to seek immediate injunctive and/or other equitable relief, without requirement of posting a bond, in addition to all other remedies available at law and/or equity and shall not be delayed in seeking such injunction and/or other equitable relief.

                                <strong>1.2.5.	Definitions:</strong>  For purposes of Section 1.2.4, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>“Final Resolution”</strong> means a permanent fix that resolves the issue. Any wait times and approvals for potential app store submissions (iOS or Google Play) are excluded from this timeline, as Lucra and the Client cannot control those wait times and approvals. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>“Initial Response”</strong> means the first contact provided to Client by Lucra.  This response may be in the form of an email message or, if email is unavailable, a documented phone call, or documented personal acknowledgement, and will normally contain the service request number for tracking purposes.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>“Update Interval”</strong> means any communication from Lucra support or product team to Client where the status and plan of action for the service request is communicated.  The purpose of these updates is to keep Client informed of the progress being made to resolve the problem reported through the incident resolution request, to gather additional details for support or troubleshooting purposes, or to communicate a resolution of the problem.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>“Workaround”</strong> means a temporary fix that resolves the issue in all material respects. Workarounds will be implemented when possible, and will only be implemented if deemed to not affect a larger or different subset of Lucra  SDK users in a substantial way.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                            <strong>1.3.	Escalation Procedures.</strong>  In the event that (a) incidents are not being communicated within the timeframes in the table above, or (b) incidents are not being resolved to Client’s reasonable satisfaction, or (c) Lucra is not getting timely response from Client in its provision of information required to resolve an incident, then the affected Party can escalate the incident in accordance with the following process:  the escalating Party will contact the other Party pursuant to the contact table below, starting with the 1st escalation. If no resolution is attained within 12 hours, then the incident or issue will be escalated to the 2nd escalation tier.  If no resolution is attained within 24 hours, then the incident or issue will be escalated to the 3rd escalation tier.
