              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Lucra is changing the game in skill-based contests disrupting
                the way that fans engage with their friends. Our fair and
                responsible platform and extensive responsible gaming policy
                ensures every Lucra User can play within their financial means.
                Lucra is committed to transparency, integrity, and fairness
                throughout our platform and we will always do everything
                possible to prevent gaming-related problems. We’ve developed
                measures to maintain a responsible, safe and reliable place for
                online gaming using the
                <a href="https://www.icrg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                  >International Center for Responsible Gaming</a
                >
                and the
                <a
                  href="https://www.responsiblegambling.org/"
                  target="_blank"

                  >Responsible Gaming Council</a
                >
                for guidance. Lucra offers all users the options to self-exclude
                and self-limit on the platform. If, at any point, you think
                you're spending too much time or money on Lucra, you have the
                option of taking a break from Lucra entirely. Self-limiting
                allows you to still play, however, within the parameters that
                you set for yourself. Lucra also provides options to limit the
                amount of funds you can deposit into your account by choosing an
                amount over a daily, weekly and monthly period.
              </p>

              <h3>Parental Controls</h3>
              <p>
                If there are children under 18 who have access to your phone,
                you may want to consider installing parental control software to
                prevent access to online gaming apps and other material.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you believe that a minor is improperly using Lucra please
                contact support@lucrasports.com
              </p>

              <h3>Limits</h3>
              <p>
                Set an alert to receive notifications when your limit
                preferences are reached or exceeded. Use the Self Control
                functionality to set and prevent yourself from going over your
                self-imposed limit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once a limit is set, you will not be able to increase that limit
                for a set number of days. If you have questions regarding limit
                preferences, please visit our FAQ.
              </p>
              <p>
                Deposit Limits: Limit the amount of funds you can deposit into
                your account by choosing an amount over a daily, weekly, or
                monthly period.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Daily Limit – Alert me or Prevent me</li>
                <li>Weekly Limit – Alert me or Prevent me</li>
                <li>Monthly Limit – Alert me or Prevent me</li>

              </ul>
              <p>

              </ul>
              <h3>Self-exclusion</h3>
              <p>
                Playing skill-based contests on Lucra should be a fun experience
                and a great way to engage in sports with your friends. To honor
                this goal, we have implemented an option for self-exclusion. If,
                at any point, you feel like you’re spending too much time or
                money on Lucra, consider self-exclusion to give yourself a
                break. You can access the self-exclusion feature through our
                Self Control functionality. This allows you to set a time frame
                during which you will be excluded and banned from participating
                on the website or the app. Please note that when you’re
                self-excluded, you will not be able to log into the Lucra iOS
                application or website to enter contests, review open contests,
                or withdraw or deposit funds until the self-exclusion time
                period you select has passed. You will also immediately be
                removed from any contests you are enrolled in, except for
                contests that are confirmed with another user. It is important
                to remember that you are in control when setting the time frame
                for your exclusion. You can extend your self-exclusion if you
                feel you need a longer break. As always, please contact our
                customer support team at support@lucrasports.com if you have any
                concerns or questions. Please see our Responsible Gaming page
                for more information on other ways to monitor your spending on
                Lucra. If you would like to permanently close your account, you
                can do so by reaching out to support@lucrasports.com as well.
