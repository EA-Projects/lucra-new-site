                <li><strong>Information Collected by Our Services</strong> <br>
                  <p>
                    As you use our Services we automatically track certain information about your visits, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, domain name, clickstream data, referring/exit pages, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Services, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and to improve our Services, for product development purposes, and to help us personalize your experience. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Services again, it will recognize you and the information appropriate to your interests.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</strong> <br>
                  <p>
                    Like many online services, we and our service providers use cookies, pixels, and other tracking technology to recognize your browser or device and to capture and remember certain information about your activities on our website. Cookies are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer or other device which may enable us to uniquely identify your browser. If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off cookies by adjusting your browser settings. If you turn off your cookies, some of the features of the website may not function properly. Pixel tags generally work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular device visits a particular page. You cannot decline pixel tags; however, if you turn off cookies the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous visit. In addition, we use pixel tags in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you prefer not to be tracked through our emails, most email services will allow you to turn off pixels by disabling external images in settings.
                  </p>

                <li><strong>Collection of Data in Connection with Advertising</strong> <br>

In connection with the delivery of advertising, certain third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to this and other websites, your IP address, your ISP and the browser you use to visit our Services. They do this by using cookies, pixel tags, or other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Services and the other websites tracked by these third parties. This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies or pixel tags in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technologies.
