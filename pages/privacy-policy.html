              <h4>Cookies</h4>
              <p>
                Like many online services, we use cookies to collect
                information. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that a
                website sends to your computer or other device which may enable
                us to uniquely identify your browser. We may use both session

                personal and interactive experience on our Service. Session
                Cookies are temporary and typically disappear after you close
                your browser. A persistent Cookie remains after you close your
                browser. Persistent Cookies may be used by your browser on
                subsequent visits to the site. Persistent Cookies can be removed
                by following your web browser help file directions. You may be
                able to reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to
                indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of
                the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept
