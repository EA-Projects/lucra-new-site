                browser. Persistent Cookies may be used by your browser on
                subsequent visits to the site. Persistent Cookies can be removed

                to this and other websites, your IP address, your ISP and the
                browser you use to visit our Sites. They do this by using

              <h4>Information Security</h4>
              <p>
                We are committed to protecting the security of your personal
                information. We use a variety of security technologies and
                procedures to help protect your personal information from
                unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
              </p>
              <p>
                While we cannot guarantee the security of information processed
                online, we do have appropriate security measures in place to
                protect your personal information. For example, we store the
                personal information you provide on computer systems with
                limited access that are located in facilities to which access is
                limited. In addition, our employees, agents, and contractors are
                required to maintain the confidentiality of your personal
                information.
              </p>
              <p>
                To further protect your privacy and security, we reserve the
                right to take reasonable steps (such as requesting your
                password) to verify your identity before granting you profile
                access or making corrections.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, you should ensure your password is kept secret at
                all times. You will be responsible for maintaining the secrecy
                of your password and account information.
              </p>

              <h4>How you Can Access or Correct your Information</h4>
              <p>
                You can request a copy of the personally-identifiable
                information that Lucra has collected about you via the Service
                by contacting us at the e-mail address listed in the "How to
                Contact Us" section below. Once we receive your request for
                access or correction, we will respond to your request within a
                reasonable period (usually no more than 30 days) after the
                request is made. There are some circumstances specified by law
                where we may refuse your request for access to or correction of
                your personal information. If one of those circumstances
                applies, we will provide you with a written explanation of the
                reasons for refusal, unless it would be unreasonable to provide
                that notice.

                  information. Such information is also set forth in this
                  Privacy Policy.

                  Provide you with information about the financial incentives
                  that we offer to you, if any.

              <p>
                The CCPA further provides you with the right to not be
                discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for

              </p>
              <p>
                We will consider all requests and provide our response within
                the time period stated by applicable law. Please note, however,
                that certain information may be exempt from such requests in
                some circumstances, which may include if we need to keep
                processing your information or to comply with a legal
                obligation. We will let you know where this is the case or if
                certain rights don't apply in your country or state of
                residence. We also will take reasonable steps to verify your
                identity before responding to a request, which might include, at
                a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you
                are requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying
                your name, email address, and date of birth. You are also
                permitted to designate an authorized agent to submit certain
                requests on your behalf. In order for an authorized agent to be
                verified, you must provide the authorized agent with signed,
                written permission to make such request or a power of attorney.
                We may also follow up with you to verify your identity before
                processing the authorized agent's request.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, exercising your deletion right may mean that you
                may no longer be able to use the Service.

              <h5>
                Notice of Right to Opt-Out of Sale of Personal Information
              </h5>
              <p>
                California residents may opt out of the "sale" of their personal
                information. California law broadly defines "sale" in a way that
                includes when we share your information with third parties, such
                as sports leagues or teams, to provide you with offers and
                promotions that we believe may be of interest to you. It also
                may include allowing third parties to receive certain
                information, such as cookies IP address and/ or browsing
                behavior, to deliver targeted advertising on the Services or
                other services. Advertising, including targeted advertising,
                enables us to provide you certain content for free and allows us
                to provide you offers relevant to you.
              </p>
              <p>
                Depending on what Services you use, we may provide the following
                categories of information to third parties for these purposes:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  For online targeted advertising purposes: demographic and
                  statistical information, usergenerated content, device
                  information and identifiers, connection and usage data,
                  geolocation, and social media information.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For sharing with third parties to send you relevant offers and
                  promotions: contact and account registration information;
                  demographic and statistical information, user-generated
                  content, and geolocation.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                If you would like to opt out of our use of your information for
                such purposes that are considered a "sale" under California law,
                you can submit a sale opt-out request by emailing us at
                <a href="mailto:support@lucrasports.com"
                  >support@lucrasports.com</a
                >.
              </p>

              <h4>Complaints</h4>
              <p>
                If you have any concerns or a complaint about a breach of your
                privacy or the way we have handled your personal information,
                please email details of your complaint to
                <a href="mailto:support@lucrasports.com"
                  >support@lucrasports.com</a
                >. We will then investigate your complaint and provide you with
                our response within a reasonable timeframe.
              </p>

              <h4>How We Respond to "DO NOT TRACK" Signals</h4>
              <p>
                Some web browsers may transmit "do not track" signals to the
                Sites and other online services with which your web browser
                communicates. There is no standard that governs what, if
                anything, the Sites should do when they receive these signals.
                We currently do not take action in response to these signals. If
                and when a standard is established, we may revise our policy on
                responding to these signals.
              </p>

              <h4>Prohibited Users</h4>
              <p>
                As indicated in our Terms of Use, employees, operators, or
                consultants of a sports governing body are prohibited from
                participating in certain Contests where such employee, operator
                or consultant is prohibited from participating in Contests by
                such governing body ("Prohibited Users"). For clarity, we say
                that examples of sports governing bodies are the National
                Football League, Major League Baseball and the National
                Basketball Association. We may report any participation in the
                Services or in any Contests by any Prohibited Users to the
                applicable sport's governing body.
              </p>

              <h4>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</h4>
              <p>
                This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically, and this will
                be reflected by the "Last Updated" date below. Please revisit
                this page to stay aware of any changes. If a revision to this
                Privacy Policy, in our sole discretion, is material, we will
                notify you by contacting you through the email address
                associated with your account. Please note that at all times you
                are responsible for ensuring that the personal information
                provided to us is up to date.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you do not wish to permit changes in our use of your personal
                information, you must notify us prior to the effective date of
                the changes that you wish to deactivate your Account with us.

                terms and conditions of such changes, with the understanding
                that the modified terms and conditions applies to all of your
                personal information, including the personal information
                collected before the change went into effect.
