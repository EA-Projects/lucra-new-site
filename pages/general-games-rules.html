              <h5>Contest of Skill</h5>
              <p>Contests offered on the Website are contests of skill. Winners are determined by the objective criteria described in the Contest deadline, Contest rules, scoring, and any other applicable documentation associated with the Contest. From all entries received for each Sports Contest, winners are determined by the individuals who use their skill and knowledge of relevant sports information and fantasy sports rules to accumulate the most points according to the corresponding scoring rules. In the case of Recreational Games Contests, additional criteria may be used to determine a Winner, such as agreement or confirmation of other entrants regarding the outcome of the contest. The Website and Contests may not be used for any form of illicit gambling.</p>

              <h5>Contest Results</h5>
              <p>Contest results and prize calculations are based on the final statistics and scoring results at the completion of the last professional sports game of each individual Contest, or, in the case of Recreational Games Contests, at the completion and following confirmation of results by all entrants. Once Contest results are reviewed and confirmed by Lucra, prizes may be awarded subject to Lucra’s Terms of Use and Contest Rules. The scoring results of a Contest will not be changed regardless of any official statistics or scoring adjustments made by the leagues at later times or dates, except in Lucra' sole discretion.</p>

              <h5>Prizes</h5>
              <p>At the conclusion of each Contest, and following confirmation of results by all entrants in the case of Recreational Game Contests, prizes will be awarded by 12:00 NOON PST on the following day except in circumstances where technical failure, inability of the Company to verify your compliance with Lucra’s Terms of Use or Contest Rules, or other reasons that prevent such timely payout. Prizes won are added to the winning participant’s account balance. In the event of a tie, prizes are divided evenly amongst the participants that have tied.</p>

              <h5>Prize Payouts</h5>
              <p>If either player in a contest is listed as inactive, the contest will be cancelled and both Lucra Users will be returned their funds. If either player in a contest has zero minutes or zero plays, is listed as DNP, or is listed as a Healthy Scratch, the contest will be voided and both Lucra Users will be returned their funds. Inactive player and zero minutes or zero plays rules account for both pre-game and in-game contests.</p>
              <p>For golf contests specifically, if a player withdrawals at any point (before or during any round), all contests associated with that player starting that day and going forward for the remainder of the tournament are voided. Both players will receive back the funds they entered into any associated contests.</p>

              <h5>Payment and Withdrawal of Prizes</h5>
              <p>Winners are posted on the Website.</p>
              
              <p>Before making any payment, Lucra may require that an entrant complete and execute an affidavit of eligibility in which, among other things, the entrant is required to represent and warrant that the entrant is eligible to participate in a Contest, is otherwise in compliance with this Agreement and, potentially, is required to provide documentation or proof of eligibility and compliance. If Lucra requests that an entrant completes and executes such an affidavit and the entrant fails to do so within seven (7) days, or Lucra otherwise determines that the entrant does not meet the eligibility requirements or is not in compliance with Lucra’s Terms of Use, Lucra reserves the right to terminate the entrant’s account and withhold or revoke the awarding of any prizes associated with such account. In such a situation, Lucra may pay out any withheld or revoked prizes to the other entrants in the relevant contest in a manner consistent with the Rules of the Contest.</p>
              
              <p>Entrants may withdraw their cash prize awards as well as cash deposits by using the "Withdrawal" option on the Website. Entrants may be requested to complete an affidavit of eligibility and a liability/publicity release (unless prohibited by law) and/or appropriate tax forms and forms of identification including but not limited to a Driver's License, Proof of Residence, and/or any information relating to payment/deposit accounts as reasonably requested by Lucra in order to complete the withdrawal of prizes. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in disqualification and forfeiture of any prizes. Disqualification or forfeiture of any prizes may also occur if it is determined any such entrant did not comply with Lucra’s Terms of Use in any manner.</p>

              <p>If you are an entrant residing in Missouri, you can withdraw the funds maintained in your individual account, whether such account is open or closed, within five (5) business days of the request being made, unless Lucra declines to honor the request for withdrawal pursuant to its Terms of Use or if Lucra believes in good faith that you engaged in either fraudulent conduct or other conduct that would put Lucra in violation of sections 313.900 to 313.1020, RSMo.  In this case, Lucra may decline to honor the request for withdrawal for a reasonable investigatory period until its investigation is resolved.  For the purposes of this provision, a request for withdrawal will be considered honored if it is processed by Lucra but delayed by a payment processor, credit card issuer, or by the custodian of a financial account.</p>

              <p>Checks for withdrawal requests are processed within 14 business days, with the exception of any such requests coming from persons physically located in Iowa, which will be processed within 5 business days, and are sent via U.S. Mail. Promotional deposits, credits, and other bonuses may not be withdrawn from a Lucra account unless appropriate terms of the promotion are achieved first by the user.</p>

              <p>All taxes associated with the receipt of any prize are the sole responsibility of the winner. In the event that the awarding of any prizes to winners of Contests is challenged by any legal authority, Lucra reserves the right in its sole discretion to determine whether or not to award such prizes.</p>

              <p>Any withdrawal requests, after approved by Lucra, will be credited back to the same credit card or method of payment used to deposit funds on the Website. Lucra will only release withdrawals to a different credit card or other payment method other than that which was used to make deposit(s) after the aggregate amount of such deposit(s) has already been released back to the credit card(s) or payment method(s) used for the deposit(s).</p>

              <p>Users may not cancel, edit, or adjust contests when they are not in a legal state eligible on the platform. Users may not add or withdraw funds when they are not in a legal state eligible on the platform. Users will be able to see their contests in a view-only state in all states, but the actions above will be restricted on a state-by-state business based on Lucra’s eligible legal states.</p>

              <p>As part of our compliance policies, users may not withdraw if they have not played a contest since depositing funds into their Account. Lucra also maintains the right to restrict users from withdrawing for a period of up to 72 hours after depositing funds into the platform.</p>

              <p>Lucra Users are required to submit their Social Security Number (“SSN”) to withdraw funds from the Website. These details are required by Lucra for you to be able to withdraw funds won on the platform. If a Social Security Number (“SSN”) is not provided by the Lucra User, they may reach out to Lucra Support for a withdrawal of any funds that they deposited on the platform. Any winnings associated with Lucra Bucks, or any other promotions provided by Lucra or earned by the Lucra User are not able to be withdrawn without a submission of a Social Security Number (“SSN”).</p>

              <p>Lucra may also run an additional Knowledge Based Authentication (“KBA”) check using the Lucra Users Social Security Number (“SSN”) to re-verify the Lucra Users identity.</p>

              <p>Lucra will not maintain any information regarding the Lucra Users Social Security Number (“SSN”) within Company servers or databases.</p>

              <h5>Verification and Withdrawal</h5>
              <p>Lucra will take appropriate steps to prevent unauthorized withdrawals from consumer accounts. Users are subject to an automated Knowledge Based Authentication ("KBA") verification process provided whenever a user attempts to withdraw funds. This process asks a series of at least four multiple choice questions about the person’s life, such as known relatives, previous addresses, and to enter their last 4 digits of their Tax ID or Social Security Number. In the event of a dispute as to the identity of a customer, Lucra, Inc. can and does require its users to produce a copy of their driver’s license, credit cards, utility bills or passport for identity verification. If a customer cannot validate their identity and account, Lucra, Inc. will not release the funds from the account. Once per month, Lucra, Inc. shall reconcile all liabilities owed to users and the sum of funds or credits in the Segregated Account, the PayPal Account, and credits due to Lucra, Inc. from credit card processors as of the end date of the immediately preceding month.</p>

              <p>Players must play a contest after depositing to be eligible to withdraw. Additionally, Lucra may restrict withdrawals for up to 72 hours after a deposit at its discretion. Requests for withdrawal will be honored by the latter of five business days for ACH or ten business days for checks unless Lucra, Inc. believes in good faith that the player engaged in either fraudulent conduct or other conduct that would put Lucra, Inc. in violation of law. A request for withdrawal will be considered honored, contingent upon the user meeting other requirements and conditions as set forth within these Terms of Service, if it is processed by Lucra, Inc. but delayed by a payment processor, credit card issuer, or by the custodian of a financial account. Players can also permanently close their account at any time for any reason through the Lucra, Inc. customer service department.</p>
