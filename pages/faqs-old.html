                    choose whether to receive funds via ACH (direct) deposit or
                    a physical check. Note that bank transfers may take 3-5
                    business days to complete and checks may take up to 10
                    business days to be sent. Reach out to

                    Lucra Bucks are Lucra’s version of “free play.” They are
                    awarded for things like referrals and can be used in place
                    of cash on the platform, however they have no cash value
                    (not eligible for withdrawal) until they are used to create
                    or accept contests. Once they are used, they are treated
                    like cash.

                    create or accept a contest and if you don’t have enough
                    funds in your account, you will be prompted to add funds. We

                    In order to make the platform a safe place for users to play against their
                    friends using real money, we need either passport or license information in
                    order to verify your information. This is a process called “Know Your
                    Customer” or “KYC”. This is an important step for us to keep Lucra safe
                    and fun for all our users.

                      Victory is sweet, but victory over your friends is just a little sweeter. With Lucra’s new
                      Games You Play feature, staking money against your friends has never been easier.
                      Long gone are the days of waiting for a friend to pay you back, or not remembering who
                      won the last competition. With the Games You Play, all you have to do is matchup with
                      a friend, pick whichever activity you're playing, and tell us who won. Lucra’s got the rest
                      covered. Whether it’s bar games, sports, fitness, board games, or video games,
                      competing with friends has never been easier! Here’s an example of what a contest
                      might look like: if Carly challenges Dylan on a game of ping pong for $10, Carly would
                      send Dylan a contest proposal on Lucra. Dylan would accept this contest before the
                      match begins. If Dylan wins the match, both users would input the match results into
                      Lucra and the winnings would be sent to Dylan automatically. If there is any contest
                      dispute over who won the match, both players enter their own result and are
                      immediately refunded and the contest is voided.

                          for dough because we hold the money in escrow until the competition is completed.
                          Additionally, users will be able to keep track of their individual stats as well as their head

                    <p class="read faq-text">
                      Lucra is a new player vs. player game in which you stake real money on a
                      player and stat (e.g., Lebron James points) versus another user’s player
                      and stat (e.g., Steph Curry points) in what we call a “contest.” Players can
                      be from the same or different sports, as long as they both compete during
                      a given week and the stats selected for each player can be the same or
                      different (e.g., can be Tom Brady touchdowns vs. Tiger Woods birdies).
                      Unlike daily fantasy or sports betting apps, you set your own terms (odds
                      and spread) for contests based on publicly available data that we provide
                      in the app, removing the dynamic where you’re betting against the House.
                      Finish up by choosing whether to send contests to a friend, a group, or the
                      Lucra public feed. Contests take less than one minute to create on
                      average, leaving you time to explore the social features that are at the
                      heart of what we built, including friending other users, creating groups,
                      smack talking, and viewing head-to-head stats. To try it out, once you’ve
                      signed up, tap the “create a contest” button or navigate to “contests” to
                      accept a contest that someone else created. Start building out your Lucra
                      network by adding friends or creating public or private groups on the
                      “friends” tab. Finally, swipe up on your account bar at the bottom of the
                      home page to easily track your contests and winnings at any time.

                    In–game contesting, or in-game wagering, allows you to make wagers

                    to a normal Lucra contest, except that the contest expires 3 minutes after
