              <h2>Eligibility</h2>
              <p>
                This sweepstakes (“Sweepstakes”) is only open to users who are 18 years of age or older as of the date
                of entry (and, if the entrant is a minor in his/her state of residence, who enter with the permission of
                a parent or guardian). The Sweepstakes is open to legal residents of the fifty United States or the
                District of Columbia, and is void where prohibited by law or regulation. Employees, independent
                contractors, interns, officers, directors, and agents of Sponsor, and their respective affiliates,
                subsidiaries, advertising and promotion agencies, suppliers and their immediate family members and/or

                Sweepstakes is subject to all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.
              </p>

              <h2>Agreement to Rules</h2>
              <p>
                By entering the Sweepstakes, the entrant ("you") agrees to comply with and abide by these official rules
                (“Rules”) and the decisions of the Sponsor, and you represent and warrant that you meet the eligibility
                requirements. In addition, you agree to accept the Sponsor's decisions as final and binding as it
                relates to the content of Sweepstakes. Entrants should look solely to the Sponsor with any questions,
                comments or issues related to the Sweepstakes.
              </p>

              <h2>Entry Period</h2>
              <p>
                The Sweepstakes begins on 20 of November, 2022 at 9:00 AM EDT and ends on 27 November, 2022 at 11:59PM
                EDT (the "Entry Period"). Entries submitted before or after the Entry Period will not be eligible.
              </p>

              <h2>How to Enter</h2>
              <p>
                The Sweepstakes must be entered by completing a contest in the Lucra sports iOS app during the entry
                period. The only method of entry is as set forth in these Official Rules. No other method of entry will
                be accepted. Any registrant that uses fake emails will be disqualified at the sole discretion of the
                Sponsor. You may not enter more times than indicated by using multiple email addresses, identities, or
                devices in an attempt to circumvent the rules. If you use fraudulent methods or otherwise attempt to
                circumvent the rules of the Sweepstakes, your submission may be disqualified at the sole discretion of
                the Sponsor. For the avoidance of doubt, Sponsor may not provide entrants with confirmation of
                Sweepstakes entry.
              </p>

              <h2>Prizes</h2>
              <p>The winner(s) of the Sweepstakes (the "Winners") will receive the following prizes:</p>
              <p>1 iPhone 14 Pro Max with 128GB in the color of your choice (depending on availability - Sponsor cannot guarantee the color of the prize)</p>
              <p>Approximate Retail Value (“ARV”) of each prize: [$1099].</p>
              <p>
                Each prize is awarded “as is” with no warranty or guarantee, either express or implied. No transfer,
                assignment or substitution of a prize permitted, except Sponsor reserves the right to substitute prize
                for an item of equal or greater value in the event any component of an advertised prize is unavailable.
                Actual/appraised value of prizes may differ at time of prize award. The specifics of the prize shall be
                solely determined by the Sponsor. No cash or other prize substitution shall be permitted except for at
                the Sponsor's discretion. The prize is non-transferable. Any and all prize related expenses, including
                without limitation any and all federal, state, and/or local taxes shall be the sole responsibility of
                the Winner. Acceptance of the prize constitutes permission for the Sponsor to use the winner’s name,
                likeness, and entry for purposes of advertising and trade without further compensation, unless
                prohibited by law. The Sponsor will not replace any lost or stolen prizes once in winner's possession.
              </p>

              <h2>Odds of Winning</h2>
              <p>The odds of winning depend on the number of eligible entries timely received.</p>

              <h2>Winner Selection and Notification</h2>
              <p>The Winners will be selected by random drawing from among all eligible entries received on or about
                November 23, 2022 under the supervision of the Sponsor. The Winner will be notified within 7 days of the
                winner selection. The Sponsor shall have no liability for a Winner's failure to receive notices due to
                spam, junk e-mail or other security settings or for a Winner’s provision of incorrect or otherwise
                non-functioning contact information. If the Winner cannot be contacted, is ineligible, fails to claim
                the prize within 7 days from the time award notification was sent, or fails to timely return a completed
                and executed Affidavit/Release as required, the prize may be forfeited, and an alternate Winner
                selected. Receipt of the prize offered in this Sweepstakes by the Winner is conditioned upon compliance
                with any and all federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Any violation of these official rules
                by the Winner at the Sponsor's sole discretion will result in the Winner's disqualification as winner,
                and all privileges as Winner will be immediately terminated.</p>

              <h2>Rights Granted by the Entrant</h2>
              <p>By entering this Sweepstakes, you understand and agree (or your parent or legal guardian understands
                and agrees, if you are a minor in your state of residence) that the Sponsor and anyone acting on behalf
                of the Sponsor or its respective licensees, successors, and assigns, shall have the right, where
                permitted by law, to print, publish, broadcast, distribute, and use in any media now known or hereafter
                developed, in perpetuity and throughout the world, without limitation, your entry, name, portrait,
                picture, voice, likeness, image, statements about the Sweepstakes, and biographical information for
                news, publicity, information, trade, advertising, public relations, and promotional purposes without any
                further compensation, notice, review, or consent.</p>

              <h2>Prize Conditions</h2>
              <p>Except where prohibited by law, a potential prize winner (or the winner’s parent or legal guardian if
                the winner is a minor in his/her state of residence) may be required to execute an Affidavit of
                Eligibility, a Liability Release and a Publicity Release, and a Tax Acceptance Form
                ("Affidavit/Release"). Such documents must be signed and returned by the date and/or time indicated
                within such documents. If the documents are not signed and returned within that time, or if an entrant
                is found to be ineligible, or if an entrant does not comply with these Official Rules, each as
                determined by Sponsor in Sponsor’s sole discretion, then the potential winner will be disqualified and
                an alternate potential winner will be selected based on the winning criteria. Entrant waives the right
                to assert as a cost of winning a prize any and all costs of verification and redemption to redeem said
                prize and any liability which might arise from redeeming or seeking to redeem said prize. Sponsor is not
                responsible for fraudulent calls or emails made to entrants not by Sponsor. All entries are subject to
                verification prior to awarding of prizes. Eligibility, age, and claims made by prize winners also are
                subject to verification prior to awarding of prizes.</p>

              <h2>Taxes</h2>
              <p>All federal, state, and local taxes and other tax liabilities (including income taxes), if any, and
                other incidental costs or expenses not identified in these rules are the sole responsibilities of the
                winners. Each winner may be required to provide the Sponsor with valid identification and a valid
                taxpayer identification number or social security number before any prize will be awarded. Entrants
                winning over $600 in prizes will receive an IRS form 1099 at the end of the calendar year, and a copy of
                such form will be filed with the IRS.</p>

              <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
              <p>The Sponsor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel, terminate, modify or suspend the
                Sweepstakes should virus, bug, non-authorized human intervention, fraud, or other cause beyond the
                Sponsor’s control corrupt or affect the administration, security, fairness, or proper conduct of the
                Sweepstakes. In such cases, the Sponsor may select a winner(s) from eligible entries received before
                and/or after the action taken by the Sponsor if appropriate. The Sponsor reserves the right at its sole
                discretion to disqualify any individual who tampers or attempts to tamper with the entry process or the
                operation of the Sweepstakes or website or violates these Terms & Conditions. The Sponsor has the right,
                in its sole discretion, to maintain the integrity of the Sweepstakes, to void entries for any reason,
                including, but not limited to: multiple entries from the same user from different IP addresses; multiple
                entries from the same computer in excess of that allowed by Sweepstakes rules; or the use of bots,
                macros, scripts, or other technical means for entering. Any attempt by an entrant to deliberately damage
                any website or undermine the legitimate operation of the Sweepstakes may be a violation of criminal and
                civil laws. Should such an attempt be made, the Sponsor reserves the right to seek damages to the
                fullest extent permitted by law.</p>

              <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
              <p>By entering the Sweepstakes, you agree to release and hold harmless Sponsor and its subsidiaries,
                affiliates, advertising and promotion agencies, partners, representatives, agents, successors, assigns,
                employees, officers and directors from any liability, illness, injury, death, loss, litigation, claim or
                damage that may occur, directly or indirectly, whether caused by negligence or not, from (i) such
                entrant’s participation in the Sweepstakes and/or his/her acceptance, possession, use, or misuse of any
                prize or any portion thereof; (ii) unauthorized human intervention in any part of the Sweepstakes; (iii)
                electronic or human error in the administration of the Sweepstakes or the processing of entries; (iv)
                technical errors of any kind, including but not limited to the malfunction of any computer, cable,
                network, hardware, or software, or other mechanical equipment; (v) the unavailability or inaccessibility
                of any transmissions, telephone, or Internet service; (vi) printing errors; (vii) lost, late, postage
                due, misdirected, or undeliverable mail.</p>

              <h2>Disputes</h2>
              <p>This Sweepstakes is governed by the laws of United States and the State of California, without respect
                to conflict of law doctrines. By participating in this Sweepstakes, you agree that any and all disputes
