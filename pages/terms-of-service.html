                provided by Lucra’s 3rd party provider, or incorrect or

                Lucra is not responsible for incomplete, illegible, misdirected
                or stolen entries. If for any reason a Contest is not capable of
                running as originally planned, or if a Contest, computer
                application, or website associated therewith (or any portion
                thereof) becomes corrupted or does not allow the proper entry to
                a Contest in accordance with the Terms of Service or applicable

                action and/or to cancel, terminate, extend, modify or suspend
                the Contest, and select the winner(s) from all eligible entries
                received. If such cancellation, termination, modification or
                suspension occurs, notification will be posted on the Website.
              </p>

              <p>

                DELIBERATELY DAMAGE THE WEBSITE OR UNDERMINE THE LEGITIMATE
                OPERATION OF ANY CONTEST IS A VIOLATION OF CRIMINAL AND/OR CIVIL
                LAWS AND SHOULD SUCH AN ATTEMPT BE MADE, LUCRA RESERVES THE
                RIGHT TO SEEK DAMAGES AND OTHER REMEDIES FROM ANY SUCH PERSON TO
                THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
              </p>

              <p>
                All contest entries become the property of Lucra and will not be
                acknowledged or returned.
              </p>
              <p>
                To be eligible to enter any contest or receive any prize, the
                Authorized Account Holder may be required to provide Lucra with
                additional documentation and/or information to verify the
                identity of the Authorized Account Holder, and to provide proof
                that all eligibility requirements are met. In the event of a
                dispute as to the identity or eligibility of an Authorized
                Account Holder, Lucra will, in its sole and absolute discretion,
                utilize certain information collected by Lucra to assist in
                verifying the identity and/or eligibility of such Authorized
                Account Holder.
              </p>
              <p>
                Participation in each Contest must be made only as specified in
                the Terms of Service and subject to any Contest rules. Failure
                to comply with these Terms of Service and Contest rules may
                result in disqualification and, if applicable, prize forfeiture.
              </p>
              <p>
                Where legal, both entrants and winner consent to the use of
                their name, voice, and likeness/photograph in and in connection
                with the development, production, distribution and/or
                exploitation of any Contest or the Website. Winners agree that
                from the date of notification by Lucra of their status as a
                potential winner and continuing until such time when Lucra
                informs them that they no longer need to do so that they will
                make themselves available to Lucra for publicity, advertising,
                and promotion activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lucra reserves the right to move entrants from the Contests they
                have entered to substantially similar Contests in certain
                situations determined by Lucra in its sole discretion.
              </p>

               <h2>White Label SDK</h2>
              <p>
                In addition to opening an account directly on Lucra’s website 
                and/or application to view and enter Contests, Users can also 
                view and access Lucra’s services through its white label wagering 
                technology by opening an account through its business-to-business 
                (“B2B”) partners’ platform, which are then created onto Lucra’s 
                Platform. In simple terms, a white label is when a product or 
                service is produced by one company that other companies rebrand 
                or market as their own. In Lucra’s case, our B2B partners integrate 
                Lucra’s software development kit (“SDK”) to add a peer-to-peer 
                social betting experience into their respective platforms. Our B2B 
                partners may have their own applicable Terms of Service, which are 
                separate from Lucra’s Terms, that you must also comply with when 
                opening an account through their platforms.
              </p>

              <h2>Contest Prizes and Promotions</h2>
              <p>
                Lucra may, at its sole discretion, issue, assign or award 
                promotional credits known as “Lucra Bucks” to certain users for 
                promotional purposes. Any such award shall be subject to these 
                Terms of Service as well as any addition rules for the promotion. 
                Users should be aware that Lucra Bucks can expire 7 days from 
                issuance, unless used in gameplay before the expiration date. 
                Lucra Bucks are also subject to revocation at Lucra’s sole 
                discretion and/or in the event that a user is found to be acting 
                outside of the rules defined in these Terms of Service or is 
                otherwise deemed by Lucra to be participating in potentially 
                suspicious, fraudulent, or illicit behavior on the Lucra 
                website or Lucra application(s). If it is confirmed that user 
                behavior is likely of a fraudulent nature or misused in a manner 
                that violates its Terms of Service, Lucra may shut down your 
                account, adjust some or all your account balance, and claw back 
                any promotional dollars or Lucra Bucks that were subsequently 
                generated from potentially illicit activity.

                may, in its sole discretion, assign an expiration or other
                limits to redemption timelines or processes for those rewards.

                of Service) (a "Dispute"), shall be determined by arbitration,
                except that you and Lucra are NOT required to arbitrate any
                Dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief
                for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade
                names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.
              </p>

              <h2>Waiver of Class Relief</h2>

              <p>
                Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you
                agree that you and Lucra will not commence against the other a
                class action, class arbitration or other representative action
                or proceeding. You and Lucra are each waiving respective rights
                to participate in a class action. By accepting this agreement,
                you give up your right to participate in any past, pending or
                future class action or any other consolidated or representative
                proceeding, including any existing as of the date of you agreed
                to these terms of use.
              </p>

              <p>
                Whether to agree to arbitration is an important decision. It is
                your decision to make and you are not required to rely solely on
                the information provided in these terms of use. You should take
                reasonable steps to conduct further research and to consult with
                counsel (at your expense) regarding the consequences of your
                decision.
              </p>

              <h2>Location of Arbitration and Applicable Rules</h2>

              <p>
                You and Lucra agree that such arbitration shall occur in San
                Francisco, California. You may request to appear in such
                proceedings telephonically. You and Lucra agree that such
                arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator in
                accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration
                Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms of Service.
              </p>

              <h2>Authority of Arbitrator</h2>

              <p>
                With the exception of class procedures and remedies as discussed
                above under "Waiver of Class Relief," the arbitrator shall have
                the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be
                available in court.
              </p>

              <h2>Confidentiality</h2>

              <p>
                You and Lucra shall maintain the confidential nature of the
                arbitration proceedings and the arbitration award, including the
                arbitration hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for
                or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as
                may be necessary in connection with a court application for a
                preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its
                enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial
                decision.
              </p>

              <h2>Allocation of Arbitration Fees</h2>

              <p>
                If you assert a Dispute as an individual, you will only be
                required to pay arbitration fees of $250 in connection with any
                arbitration under this section, and Lucra will bear all other
                costs charged by AAA or the arbitrator up to $5,000. You will
                still be responsible for paying your own attorneys’ fees.
              </p>

              <p>
                Each party shall bear its own costs in the arbitration
                proceeding. If any portion of this section entitled "Binding
                Arbitration and Class Waiver" is determined by a court to be
                inapplicable or invalid, then the remainder shall still be given
                full force and effect.
              </p>

              <h3>Other Legal Restrictions</h3>
              <h2>Contest of Skill</h2>
              <p>
                Contests offered on the Website are contests of skill. Winners
                are determined by the objective criteria described in the
                Contest deadline, Contest rules, scoring, and any other
                applicable documentation associated with the Contest. From all
                entries received for each Sports Contest, winners are determined
                by the individuals who use their skill and knowledge of relevant
                sports information and fantasy sports rules to accumulate the
                most points according to the corresponding scoring rules. In the
                case of Recreational Games Contests, additional criteria may be
                used to determine a Winner, such as agreement or confirmation of
                other entrants regarding the outcome of the contest. The Website
                and Contests may not be used for any form of illicit gambling.
              </p>

              <h2>Contest Statistics and Live Scoring</h2>
              <p>
                To the extent that we offer 'live' statistics during gameplay,
                all 'live' statistics and other information provided through the
                Lucra Website and related information sources are unofficial.
                Live sports statistics and their respective components are
                offered for informational and/or entertainment purposes only and
                are not used to determine the results of our Contests. While
                Lucra and the third parties used to provide the Lucra Services
                use reasonable efforts to include accurate and up-to-date
                information, neither Lucra nor its third party providers warrant
                or make any representations of any kind with respect to the
                information provided through the Lucra Website and related
                information sources. Lucra and its third party providers shall
                not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, usefulness, or
                availability of any information transmitted or made available
                via the Lucra Website and related information sources, and shall
                not be responsible or liable for any error or omissions in that
                information. All statistics shown on Lucra are publicly
                available and are not suggestions from Lucra in any way.
              </p>

              <h2>Contest Results</h2>
              <p>
                Contest results and prize calculations are based on the final statistics and scoring results at the completion of the last professional sports game of each individual Contest, or, in the case of Recreational Games Contests, at the completion and following confirmation of results by all entrants. Once Contest results are reviewed and confirmed by Lucra, prizes may be awarded subject to these Terms. The scoring results of a Contest will not be changed regardless of any official statistics or scoring adjustments made by the leagues at later times or dates, except in Lucra' sole discretion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lucra reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion,
                to deny any contestant the ability to participate in
                head-to-head contests for any reason whatsoever. Further, Lucra
                may, in its sole and absolute discretion, invalidate any
                head-to-head contest result for the purposes of preventing
                abusive and/or any unfair or potentially unlawful activity, or
                in the event that there is a risk of any such abusive, illegal,
                or unfair activity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lucra employees and consultants are eligible to play contests on
                the Lucra platform. Employees and consultants have no additional
                information or advantage against other users. Since Lucra is a
                peer-to-peer platform and is not booking any bets as the house,
                Lucra is indifferent to whether their employees and consultants
                win or lose on the platform.
              </p>

              <h2>Prizes</h2>
              <p>
                At the conclusion of each Contest, and following confirmation of
                results by all entrants in the case of Recreational Game
                Contests, prizes will be awarded by 12:00 NOON PST on the
                following day except in circumstances where technical failure,
                inability of the Company to verify your compliance with these
                Terms, or other reasons prevent such timely payout. Prizes won
                are added to the winning participants account balance. In the
                event of a tie, prizes are divided evenly amongst the
                participants that have tied.
              </p>

              <h2>Prize Payouts</h2>
              <p>
                Contest prize payouts will be published with the creation of
                each new contest. Lucra reserves the right, in its sole
                discretion, to cancel or suspend the contests (or any portion
                thereof) should virus, bugs, unauthorized human intervention, or
                other causes corrupt administration, security, fairness,
                integrity or proper operation of the contest (or any portion
                thereof) warrant doing so. Notification of such changes may be
                provided by Lucra to its customers but will not be required.
              </p>
              <p>If either player in a contest is listed as inactive, the contest will be cancelled and both Lucra Users will be returned their funds. If either player in a contest has zero minutes or zero plays, is listed as DNP, or is listed as a Healthy Scratch, the contest will be voided and both Lucra Users will be returned their funds. Inactive player and zero minutes or zero plays rules account for both pre-game and in-game contests.</p>
              <p>For golf contests specifically, if a player with withdrawals at any point (before or during any round), all contests associated with that player starting that day and going forward for the remainder of the tournament are voided. Both players will receive back the funds they entered into any associated contests.</p>

              <h2>Payment and Withdrawal of Prizes</h2>
              <p>Winners are posted on the Website.</p>
              <p>
                Before making any payment, Lucra may require that an entrant
                complete and execute an affidavit of eligibility in which, among
                other things, the entrant is required to represent and warrant
                that the entrant is eligible to participate in a Contest, is
                otherwise in compliance with this Agreement and, potentially, is
                required to provide documentation or proof of eligibility and
                compliance. If Lucra requests that an entrant completes and
                executes such an affidavit and the entrant fails to do so within
                seven (7) days, or Lucra otherwise determines that the entrant
                does not meet the eligibility requirements or is not in
                compliance with these Terms, Lucra reserves the right to
                terminate the entrant’s account and withhold or revoke the
                awarding of any prizes associated with such account. In such a
                situation, Lucra may pay out any withheld or revoked prizes to
                the other entrants in the relevant contest in a manner
                consistent with the Rules of the Contest.
              </p>
              <p>
                Entrants may withdraw their cash prize awards as well as cash
                deposits by using the "Withdrawal" option on the Website.
                Entrants may be requested to complete an affidavit of
                eligibility and a liability/publicity release (unless prohibited
                by law) and/or appropriate tax forms and forms of identification
                including but not limited to a Driver's License, Proof of
                Residence, and/or any information relating to payment/deposit
                accounts as reasonably requested by Lucra in order to complete
                the withdrawal of prizes. Failure to comply with this
                requirement may result in disqualification and forfeiture of any
                prizes. Disqualification or forfeiture of any prizes may also
                occur if it is determined any such entrant did not comply with
                these Terms of Service in any manner.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are an entrant residing in Missouri, you can withdraw the
                funds maintained in your individual account, whether such
                account is open or closed, within five (5) business days of the
                request being made, unless Lucra believes in good faith that you
                engaged in either fraudulent conduct or other conduct that would
                put Lucra in violation of sections 313.900 to 313.1020, RSMo, in
                which case Lucra may decline to honor the request for withdrawal
                for a reasonable investigatory period until its investigation is
                resolved if it provides notice of the nature of the
                investigation to you. For the purposes of this provision, a
                request for withdrawal will be considered honored if it is
                processed by Lucra but delayed by a payment processor, credit
                card issuer, or by the custodian of a financial account.
              </p>
              <p>
                Checks for withdrawal requests are processed within 14 business
                days, with the exception of any such requests coming from
                persons physically located in Iowa, which will be processed
                within 5 business days, and are sent via U.S. Mail. Promotional
                deposits, credits, and other bonuses may not be withdrawn from a
                Lucra account unless appropriate terms of the promotion are
                achieved first by the user.
              </p>

              <p>
                All taxes associated with the receipt of any prize are the sole
                responsibility of the winner. In the event that the awarding of
                any prizes to winners of Contests is challenged by any legal
                authority, Lucra reserves the right in its sole discretion to
                determine whether or not to award such prizes.
              </p>

              <p>
                No substitution or transfer of prize is permitted. All prizes
                are awarded "as is" and without warranty of any kind, express or
                implied (including, without limitation, any implied warranty of
                merchantability for a particular purpose).
              </p>
              <p>
                Any withdrawal requests, after approved by Lucra, will be
                credited back to the same credit card or method of payment used
                to deposit funds on the Website. Lucra will only release
                withdrawals to a different credit card or other payment method
                other than that which was used to make deposit(s) after the
                aggregate amount of such deposit(s) has already been released
                back to the credit card(s) or payment method(s) used for the
                deposit(s).
              </p>
              <p>
                Users may not cancel, edit, or adjust contests when they are not
                in a legal state eligible on the platform. Users may not add or
                withdraw funds when they are not in a legal state eligible on
                the platform. Users will be able to see their contests in a
                view-only state in all states, but the actions above will be
                restricted on a state-by-state business based on Lucra’s
                eligible legal states.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of our compliance policies, users may not withdraw if
                they have not played a contest since depositing funds into their
                Account. In addition to the requirement that users must play a
                contest once funds are deposited into their Account, users are
                not able to withdraw funds within 72 hours of depositing funds.
              </p>

              <p>Lucra Users are required to submit their Social Security Number (“SSN”) to withdraw funds from the Website. These details are required by Lucra for you to be able to withdraw funds won on the platform. If a Social Security Number (“SSN”) is not provided by the Lucra User, they may reach out to Lucra Support for a withdrawal of any funds that they deposited on the platform. Any winnings associated with Lucra Bucks, or any other promotions provided by Lucra or earned by the Lucra User are not able to be withdrawn without a submission of a Social Security Number (“SSN”).</p>

              <p>Lucra may also run an additional Knowledge Based Authentication (“KBA”) check using the Lucra Users Social Security Number (“SSN”) to re-verify the Lucra Users identity.</p>

              <p>Lucra will not maintain any information regarding the Lucra Users Social Security Number (“SSN”) within Company servers or databases.</p>

              <h2>Verification and Withdrawal</h2>
              <p>
                Lucra, Inc. will take appropriate steps to prevent unauthorized
                withdrawals from consumer accounts. Users are subject to an
                automated Knowledge Based Authentication ("KBA") verification
                process provided whenever a user attempts to withdraw funds.
                This process asks a series of at least four multiple choice
                questions about the person’s life, such as known relatives,
                previous addresses, and to enter their last 4 digits of their
                Tax ID or Social Security Number. In the event of a dispute as
                to the identity of a customer, Lucra, Inc. can and does require
                its users to produce a copy of their driver’s license, credit
                cards, utility bills or passport for identity verification. If a
                customer cannot validate their identity and account, Lucra, Inc.
                will not release the funds from the account. Once per month,
                Lucra, Inc. shall reconcile all liabilities owed to users and
                the sum of funds or credits in the Segregated Account, the
                PayPal Account, and credits due to Lucra, Inc. from credit card
                processors as of the end date of the immediately preceding
                month.

                Players who believe that funds held in their accounts with
                Lucra, Inc. have been misallocated, compromised or otherwise
                mishandled, may register a complaint with Lucra, Inc. online by
                e-mailing
                <a href="mailto:support@LucraSports.com"

                >
                or calling 201-781-5977. Lucra, Inc. shall use its best efforts
                to respond to such complaints within ten (10) days. If Lucra,
                Inc. determines that the relief requested in the complaint will
                not be granted, its response will set forth the specific
                reasons, therefore. If more information is required for Lucra
                Inc. to process the complaint, the response will note the form

              <p>
                A player can request to withdraw funds from their account at any
                time. Players must play a contest and the deposit of funds must
                have occurred no less than 72 hours from the time a withdrawal
                is requested before the withdrawal request will be considered.
                Requests for withdrawal will be honored by the later of five
                business days or ten business days of submission of any tax
                reporting paperwork required by law, unless Lucra, Inc. believes
                in good faith that the player engaged in either fraudulent
                conduct or other conduct that would put Lucra, Inc. in violation
                of California state law. A request for withdrawal will be
                considered honored, contingent upon the user meeting other
                requirements and conditions as set forth within these Terms of
                Service, if it is processed by Lucra, Inc. but delayed by a
                payment processor, credit card issuer, or by the custodian of a
                financial account. Players can also permanently close their
                account at any time for any reason through the Lucra, Inc.
                customer service department.

              <h2>Transaction, Withdrawal, and Deposit Limits</h2>
              <p>
                Upon starting operations, Lucra will establish and maintain
                transaction limits on its activities in order to mitigate
                BSA/AML/OFAC risks. The Company, in its sole discretion, may
                establish limits that could include each of the following types
                of transaction activity: per transaction, per day, per contest,
                per deposit, and/or per withdrawal.
              </p>

              <h2>Termination and Effect of Termination</h2>
              <p>
                In addition to any other legal or equitable remedy, Lucra may,
                without prior notice, immediately revoke any or all of your
                rights granted hereunder. In such event, you will immediately
                cease all access to and use of the Lucra Website. Lucra may
                revoke any password(s) and/or account identification issued to
                you and deny you access to and use of the Website. Any such
                action shall not affect any rights and obligations arising prior
                thereto. All provisions of the Terms of Service which by their
                nature should survive termination shall survive termination,
                including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty
                disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.
              </p>

              <h2>Abandoned Account Policy</h2>
              <p>
                If your Lucra account has no activity for twenty-four (24)
                months, it will be considered inactive. Lucra will assess fee of
                $2.99 per month on all inactive accounts until the account is
                reactivated by entering a contest, making a deposit, or
                withdrawing funds. Lucra will provide all users subject to an
                inactivity fee with at least thirty (30) days’ notice prior to
                deducting any fees.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your account remains inactive for the amount of time
                specified by applicable state law, usually between thirty-six
                (36) and sixty (60) months, it will be considered abandoned.
                Once an account is abandoned, Lucra, Inc. is required by state
                law to remit the abandoned funds to the appropriate state agency
                as unclaimed property. Lucra may also charge additional fees
                associated with the delivery of abandoned funds to the
                applicable state agency.
              </p>
              <p>If a user account has been suspended or blocked, for over 30 days, Lucra retains the right to close the account and remove any outstanding lucra bucks or cash balance that was obtained through activity that violates our terms of service, including but not limited to promotion abuse, multiple accounts, or fraudulent activities.</p>

              <p>
                Nothing in the Terms of Service shall create or be deemed to

                Third-party online publishers that refer users to the Lucra
                website shall not be responsible or liable for the Lucra website

              <p>
                <strong>SEVERABILITY</strong> In the event any provision of
                these Terms is held unenforceable, such provision will be
                ineffective but shall not affect the enforceability of the
                remaining provisions. To the fullest extent allowable by law and
                equity, the parties agree that any such provision may be
                blue-penciled or otherwise revised by the forum presiding over
                any dispute to give effect to the intent of the parties and
                consistent with the overall purpose and intent of the agreement,
                and may be replaced by an enforceable provision that comes
                closest to the intention underlying the unenforceable provision.
              </p>

              <p>
                No waiver of any term of these Terms of Service shall be deemed
                a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term,
                and Lucra' failure to assert any right or provision under these
                Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
                provision.
              </p>

              <p>
                The failure of Lucra to comply with any provision of these Terms
                of Service due to an act of God, hurricane, war, fire, riot,
                earthquake, terrorism, act of public enemies, actions of
                governmental authorities outside of the control of the Company
                (excepting compliance with applicable codes and regulations) or
                other force majeure event will not be considered a breach of
                these Terms of Service.
