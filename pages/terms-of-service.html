                misuse of any prize or while preparing for, participating in
                and/or travelling to or from any prize related activity, as well
                as any claims based on publicity rights, defamation, or invasion
                of privacy. Lucra may, in its sole and absolute discretion,
                require an Authorized Account Holder to execute a separate
                release of claims similar to the one listed above in this
                Paragraph as a condition of being awarded any prize or receiving
                any payout.

                Lucra is not responsible for incomplete, illegible, misdirected
                or stolen entries. If for any reason a Contest is not capable of
                running as originally planned, or if a Contest, computer
                application, or website associated therewith (or any portion
                thereof) becomes corrupted or does not allow the proper entry to
                a Contest in accordance with the Terms of Use or applicable

                DELIBERATELY DAMAGE THE WEBSITE OR UNDERMINE THE LEGITIMATE
                OPERATION OF ANY CONTEST IS A VIOLATION OF CRIMINAL AND/OR CIVIL
                LAWS AND SHOULD SUCH AN ATTEMPT BE MADE, LUCRA RESERVES THE
                RIGHT TO SEEK DAMAGES AND OTHER REMEDIES FROM ANY SUCH PERSON TO

                Authorized Account Holder may be required to provide Lucra with
                additional documentation and/or information to verify the
                identity of the Authorized Account Holder, and to provide proof
                that all eligibility requirements are met. In the event of a
                dispute as to the identity or eligibility of an Authorized
                Account Holder, Lucra will, in its sole and absolute discretion,
                utilize certain information collected by Lucra to assist in
                verifying the identity and/or eligibility of such Authorized
                Account Holder.

                Participation in each Contest must be made only as specified in

              <h3>Other Legal Restrictions</h3>
              <h4>Contest of Skill</h4>
              <p>
                Contests offered on the Website are contests of skill. Winners
                are determined by the objective criteria described in the
                Contest deadline, Rules, scoring, and any other applicable
                documentation associated with the Contest. From all entries
                received for each Contest, winners are determined by the
                individuals who use their skill and knowledge of relevant sports
                information and fantasy sports rules to accumulate the most
                points according to the corresponding scoring rules. The Website
                and Contests may not be used for any form of illicit gambling.
              </p>

              <h4>Contest Statistics and Live Scoring</h4>
              <p>
                To the extent that we offer 'live' statistics during gameplay,
                all 'live' statistics and other information provided through the
                Lucra Website and related information sources are unofficial.
                Live sports statistics and their respective components are
                offered for informational and/or entertainment purposes only and
                are not used to determine the results of our Contests. While
                Lucra and the third parties used to provide the Lucra Services
                use reasonable efforts to include accurate and up-to-date
                information, neither Lucra nor its third party providers warrant
                or make any representations of any kind with respect to the
                information provided through the Lucra Website and related
                information sources. Lucra and its third party providers shall
                not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, usefulness, or
                availability of any information transmitted or made available
                via the Lucra Website and related information sources, and shall
                not be responsible or liable for any error or omissions in that
                information. All statistics shown on Lucra are publicly
                available and are not suggestions from Lucra in any way.
              </p>

              <h4>Contest Results</h4>
              <p>
                Contest results and prize calculations are based on the final
                statistics and scoring results at the completion of the last
                professional sports game of each individual Contest. Once
                Contest results are reviewed and graded, prizes are awarded. The
                scoring results of a Contest will not be changed regardless of
                any official statistics or scoring adjustments made by the
                leagues at later times or dates, except in Lucra' sole
                discretion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lucra reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion,
                to deny any contestant the ability to participate in
                head-to-head contests for any reason whatsoever. Further, Lucra
                may, in its sole and absolute discretion, invalidate any
                head-to-head contest result for the purposes of preventing
                abusive and/or any unfair or potentially unlawful activity, or
                in the event that there is a risk of any such abusive, illegal,
                or unfair activity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lucra employees and consultants are eligible to play contests on
                the Lucra platform. Employees and consultants have no additional
                information or advantage against other users. Since Lucra is a
                peer-to-peer platform and is not booking any bets as the house,
                Lucra is indifferent to whether their employees and consultants
                win or lose on the platform.
              </p>

              <h4>Prizes</h4>
              <p>
                At the conclusion of each Contest, prizes will be awarded by
                12:00 NOON PST on the following day except in circumstances
                where technical failure, inability of the Company to verify your
                compliance with these Terms, or other reasons prevent such
                timely payout. Prizes won are added to the winning participants
                account balance. In the event of a tie, prizes are divided
                evenly amongst the participants that have tied.
              </p>

              <h4>Prize Payouts</h4>
              <p>
                Contest prize payouts will be published with the creation of
                each new contest. Lucra reserves the right, in its sole
                discretion, to cancel or suspend the contests (or any portion
                thereof) should virus, bugs, unauthorized human intervention, or
                other causes corrupt administration, security, fairness,
                integrity or proper operation of the contest (or any portion
                thereof) warrant doing so. Notification of such changes may be
                provided by Lucra to its customers but will not be required.
              </p>

              <h4>Payment and Withdrawal of Prizes</h4>
              <p>Winners are posted on the Website.</p>
              <p>
                Before making any payment, Lucra may require that an entrant
                complete and execute an affidavit of eligibility in which, among
                other things, the entrant is required to represent and warrant
                that the entrant is eligible to participate in a Contest, is
                otherwise in compliance with this Agreement and, potentially, is
                required to provide documentation or proof of eligibility and
                compliance. If Lucra requests that an entrant completes and
                executes such an affidavit and the entrant fails to do so within
                seven (7) days, or Lucra otherwise determines that the entrant
                does not meet the eligibility requirements or is not in
                compliance with these Terms, Lucra reserves the right to
                terminate the entrant’s account and withhold or revoke the
                awarding of any prizes associated with such account. In such a
                situation, Lucra may pay out any withheld or revoked prizes to
                the other entrants in the relevant contest in a manner
                consistent with the Rules of the Contest.
              </p>
              <p>
                Entrants may withdraw their cash prize awards as well as cash
                deposits by using the "Withdrawal" option on the Website.
                Entrants may be requested to complete an affidavit of
                eligibility and a liability/publicity release (unless prohibited
                by law) and/or appropriate tax forms and forms of identification
                including but not limited to a Driver's License, Proof of
                Residence, and/or any information relating to payment/deposit
                accounts as reasonably requested by Lucra in order to complete
                the withdrawal of prizes. Failure to comply with this
                requirement may result in disqualification and forfeiture of any
                prizes. Disqualification or forfeiture of any prizes may also
                occur if it is determined any such entrant did not comply with
                these Terms of Use in any manner.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are an entrant residing in Missouri, you can withdraw the
                funds maintained in your individual account, whether such
                account is open or closed, within five (5) business days of the
                request being made, unless Lucra believes in good faith that the
                you engaged in either fraudulent conduct or other conduct that
                would put Lucra in violation of sections 313.900 to 313.1020,
                RSMo, in which case Lucra may decline to honor the request for
                withdrawal for a reasonable investigatory period until its
                investigation is resolved if it provides notice of the nature of
                the investigation to you. For the purposes of this provision, a
                request for withdrawal will be considered honored if it is
                processed by Lucra but delayed by a payment processor, credit
                card issuer, or by the custodian of a financial account.
              </p>
              <p>
                Checks for withdrawal requests are processed within 14 business
                days, with the exception of any such requests coming from
                persons physically located in Iowa, which will be processed
                within 5 business days, and are sent via U.S. Mail. Promotional
                deposits, credits, and other bonuses may not be withdrawn from a
                Lucra account unless appropriate terms of the promotion are
                achieved first by the user.
              </p>

              <p>
                All taxes associated with the receipt of any prize are the sole
                responsibility of the winner. In the event that the awarding of
                any prizes to winners of Contests is challenged by any legal
                authority, Lucra reserves the right in its sole discretion to
                determine whether or not to award such prizes.
              </p>

              <p>
                No substitution or transfer of prize is permitted. All prizes
                are awarded "as is" and without warranty of any kind, express or
                implied (including, without limitation, any implied warranty of
                merchantability for a particular purpose).
              </p>
              <p>
                Any withdrawal requests, after approved by Lucra, will be
                credited back to the same credit card or method of payment used
                to deposit funds on the Website. Lucra will only release
                withdrawals to a different credit card or other payment method
                other than that which was used to make deposit(s) after the
                aggregate amount of such deposit(s) has already been released
                back to the credit card(s) or payment method(s) used for the
                deposit(s).
              </p>
              <p>
                Users may not cancel, edit, or adjust contests when they are not
                in a legal state eligible on the platform. Users may not add or
                withdraw funds when they are not in a legal state eligible on
                the platform. Users will be able to see their contests in a
                view-only state in all states, but the actions above will be
                restricted on a state-by-state business based on Lucra’s
                eligible legal states.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of our compliance policies, users may not withdraw if
                they have not played a contest since depositing funds into their
                Account. In addition to the requirement that users must play a
                contest once funds are deposited into their Account, users are
                not able to withdraw funds within 72 hours of depositing funds.
              </p>

              <h4>Verification and Withdrawal</h4>
              <p>
                Lucra, Inc. will take appropriate steps to prevent unauthorized
                withdrawals from consumer accounts. Users are subject to an
                automated Knowledge Base Authentication ("KBA") verification
                process provided whenever a user attempts to withdraw funds.
                This process asks a series of at least four multiple choice
                questions about the person’s life, such as known relatives,

                Players who believe that funds held by or their accounts with
                Lucra Inc. have been misallocated, compromised or otherwise
                mishandled, may register a complaint with Lucra, Inc. online by

                to respond to such complaints within ten (10) days. If Lucra,

                not be granted, its response will set forth the specific reasons
                therefore. If more information is required for Lucra Inc. to
                process the complaint, the response will note the form and

              <p>
                A player can request to withdraw funds from their account at any
                time. Players must play a contest and the deposit of funds must
                have occurred no less than 72 hours from the time a withdrawal
                is requested before the withdrawal request will be considered.
                Requests for withdrawal will be honored by the later of five
                business days or ten business days of submission of any tax
                reporting paperwork required by law, unless Lucra, Inc. believes
                in good faith that the player engaged in either fraudulent
                conduct or other conduct that would put Lucra, Inc. in violation
                of Delaware state law. A request for withdrawal will be
                considered honored, contingent upon the user meeting other
                requirements and conditions as set forth within these Terms of
                Service, if it is processed by Lucra, Inc. but delayed by a
                payment processor, credit card issuer, or by the custodian of a
                financial account. Players can also permanently close their
                account at any time for any reason through the Lucra, Inc.
                customer service department.
              </p>

              <h4>Transaction, Withdrawal, and Deposit Limits</h4>
              <p>
                Upon starting operations, Lucra will establish and maintain
                transaction limits on its activities in order to mitigate
                BSA/AML/OFAC risks. The Company, in its sole discretion, may
                establish limits that could include each of the following types
                of transaction activity: per transaction, per day, per contest,
                per deposit, and/or per withdrawal.
              </p>

              <h4>Termination and Effect of Termination</h4>
              <p>
                In addition to any other legal or equitable remedy, Lucra may,
                without prior notice, immediately revoke any or all of your
                rights granted hereunder. In such event, you will immediately
                cease all access to and use of the Lucra Website. Lucra may
                revoke any password(s) and/or account identification issued to
                you and deny you access to and use of the Website. Any such
                action shall not affect any rights and obligations arising prior
                thereto. All provisions of the Terms of Use which by their
                nature should survive termination shall survive termination,
                including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty
                disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.
              </p>

              <h4>Abandoned Account Policy</h4>
              <p>
                If your Lucra account has no activity for twenty-four (24)
                months, it will be considered inactive. Lucra will assess fee of
                $2.99 per month on all inactive accounts until the account is
                reactivated by entering a contest, making a deposit, or
                withdrawing funds. Lucra will provide all users subject to an
                inactivity fee with at least thirty (30) days notice prior to
                deducting any fees.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your account remains inactive for the amount of time
                specified by applicable state law, usually between thirty-six
                (36) and sixty (60) months, it will be considered abandoned.
                Once an account is abandoned, Lucra, Inc. is required by state law
                to remit the abandoned funds to the appropriate state agency as
                unclaimed property. Lucra may also charge additional fees
                associated with the delivery of abandoned funds to the
                applicable state agency.

                We respect your ownership of User Submissions. If you owned a

                owning it after providing it to us, subject to any rights
                granted in the Terms of Use and any access granted to others. If
                you delete a User Submission from the Services, our general
                license to that User Submission will end after a reasonable
                period of time required for the deletion to take full effect.
                However, the User Submission may still exist in our backup
                copies, which are not publicly available. If your User
                Submission is shared with third parties, those third parties may
                have retained copies of your User Submissions. In addition, if
                we made use of your User Submission before you deleted it, we
                will continue to have the right to make, duplicate,
                redistribute, and sublicense those pre-existing uses, even after
                you delete the User Submission. Terminating your account on a

              <p>
                We may refuse or remove a User Submission without notice to you.

                such court does not have personal jurisdiction or that the Forum
                is not appropriate or convenient; (b) you and Lucra waive any

              <h4>Taxation</h4>
              <p>
                Each year all winners who have won $600 or more over the
                previous year must provide updated address and social security
                details to Lucra. These details will be used to allow Lucra to
                comply with tax regulations and may be shared with appropriate
                tax authorities. You, not Lucra, are responsible for filing and
                paying applicable state and federal taxes on any winnings. Lucra
                does not provide tax advice, nor should any statements in this
                agreement or on the Service be construed as tax advice.

                These Terms of Use shall be governed by the internal substantive
                laws of the State of Delaware, without respect to its conflict

                that arises in whole or in part from the Terms of Use, the

                of competent jurisdiction located in New Castle County,

                the Website, you agree to indemnify, protect, defend and hold

                agents and representatives (the "Lucra Entities"), from and

                damages, injuries, demands, actions, causes of action, suits,
                proceedings, judgments and expenses, including reasonable
                attorneys’ fees, court costs and other legal expenses including,
                without limitation, those costs incurred at the trial and
                appellate levels and in any bankruptcy, reorganization,
                insolvency or other similar proceedings, and any other legal
                expenses (collectively, "Claims") arising from or connected with
                your use of the Website, any payment methods used, any funding
                of your account, and/or your participation in any Contest. The

                Lucra' failure to assert any right or provision under these
                Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
                provision.

                changes. The failure of Lucra to comply with any provision of
                these Terms of Use due to an act of God, hurricane, war, fire,
                riot, earthquake, terrorism, act of public enemies, actions of
