                <p class="read faq-text">
                  Lucra is a new player vs. player game in which you stake
                  real money on a player and stat (e.g., Lebron James points)
                  versus another user’s player and stat (e.g., Steph Curry
                  points) in what we call a “contest.” Players can be from the
                  same or different sports, as long as they both compete
                  during a given week and the stats selected for each player
                  can be the same or different (e.g., can be Tom Brady
                  touchdowns vs. Tiger Woods birdies). Unlike daily fantasy or
                  sports betting apps, you set your own terms (odds and
                  spread) for contests based on publicly available data that
                  we provide in the app, removing the dynamic where you’re
                  betting against the House. Finish up by choosing whether to
                  send contests to a friend, a group, or the Lucra public
                  feed. Contests take less than one minute to create on
                  average, leaving you time to explore the social features
                  that are at the heart of what we built, including friending
                  other users, creating groups, smack talking, and viewing
                  head-to-head stats. To try it out, once you’ve signed up,
                  tap the “create a contest” button or navigate to “contests”
                  to accept a contest that someone else created. Start
                  building out your Lucra network by adding friends or
                  creating public or private groups on the “friends” tab.
                  Finally, swipe up on your account bar at the bottom of the
                  home page to easily track your contests and winnings at any
                  time.

                <h3 class="faq-heading">What is a live wager?</h3>
                <p class="read faq-text">
                  Live wagering, or in-game wagering, allows you to make wagers after the game has already started. The
                  structure of the contest is similar to a normal Lucra contest, except that the contest expires 3
                  minutes after creation.

                <p class="read faq-text">
                  Each sport has specific rules around when during the game you can create a live wager.
                  The following amount of time must be left in a game in order to wager on each of the following:
                </p>

                  awarded for things like referrals and can be used in place
                  of cash on the platform, however they have no cash value
                  (not eligible for withdrawal) until they are used to create
                  or accept contests. Once they are used, they are treated
