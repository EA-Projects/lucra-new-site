                  <p class="read faq-text">
                    Lucra is a new player vs. player game in which you stake
                    real money on a player and stat (e.g., Lebron James points)
                    versus another user’s player and stat (e.g., Steph Curry
                    points) in what we call a “contest.” Players can be from the
                    same or different sports, as long as they both compete
                    during a given week and the stats selected for each player
                    can be the same or different (e.g., can be Tom Brady
                    touchdowns vs. Tiger Woods birdies). Unlike daily fantasy or
                    sports betting apps, you set your own terms (odds and
                    spread) for contests based on publicly available data that
                    we provide in the app, removing the dynamic where you’re
                    betting against the House. Finish up by choosing whether to
                    send contests to a friend, a group, or the Lucra public
                    feed. Contests take less than one minute to create on
                    average, leaving you time to explore the social features
                    that are at the heart of what we built, including friending
                    other users, creating groups, smack talking, and viewing
                    head-to-head stats. To try it out, once you’ve signed up,
                    tap the “create a contest” button or navigate to “contests”
                    to accept a contest that someone else created. Start
                    building out your Lucra network by adding friends or
                    creating public or private groups on the “friends” tab.
                    Finally, swipe up on your account bar at the bottom of the
                    home page to easily track your contests and winnings at any
                    time.

                    In–game contesting, or in-game wagering, allows you to make
                    wagers after the game has already started. The structure of
                    the contest is similar to a normal Lucra contest, except
                    that the contest expires 3 minutes after creation.

                    You can create or accept contests that involve any two
                    players from the same or different sports as long as they
                    both have competitions that week that have not yet begun.
                    Once a competition starts, you will be unable to create a
                    contest involving a player from that game.

                  <p class="read faq-text">
                    If an athlete doesn’t play (for injury, illness, or any
                    other reason) prior to the start of the competition, then a
                    contest involving that athlete will be canceled and all
                    wagers will be refunded.

                    Can I edit a contest once it has been created?

                  <p class="read faq-text">
                    Once you create a contest, you may edit it as long as nobody
                    has accepted the other side. As soon as an opponent accepts
                    the contest, it is live and can no longer be edited.
