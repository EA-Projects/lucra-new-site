                  <h5 class="faq-heading">Why play Lucra?</h5>
                  <p class="read faq-text">
                    Playing Lucra is about having fun and fostering friendly competition. It’s a way to make new friends and reconnect with old ones, creating social connections and turning competitive moments into lasting moments. Lucra connects users on consumer platforms with others who share an interest in competition, enhancing their engagement with a platform they know and love.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li class="faq-box">
                  <h5 class="faq-heading">Why partner with Lucra?</h5>
                  <p class="read faq-text">
                    Partnering with Lucra enables people to foster connections within a platform, turning fans to friends and individuals to teammates. Lucra doesn’t create the competition—instead, it creates shared experiences around the existing game at hand, allowing Lucra’s clients to engage with their users in a way that is familiar and fun. Whether it’s something you are watching or playing, Lucra creates a digital community by allowing people to compete with each other inside a platform they already know and trust.

                <li class="faq-box">
                  <h5 class="faq-heading">Why is “Games You Play” a skill-based game?</h5>
                  <p class="read faq-text">
                    The “Games You Play” contests on Lucra are bona fide contests of skill in which the outcome of the activity is 1) entirely or primarily dependent upon the knowledge, ability, strength, speed or endurance of the participants, intelligence; and 2) subject to the control of the participants. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    All “Games You Play” contests on Lucra are: <strong>(a)</strong> based on the physical or mental play of the actual participants in the contests; <strong>(b)</strong> limited geographically to certain jurisdictions; and <strong>(c)</strong> subject to geolocation and age controls (i.e. 18+).
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li class="faq-box">
                  <h5 class="faq-heading">Is Lucra’s technology sports betting?</h5>
                  <p class="read faq-text">
                    No. Our peer-to-peer technology allows for users who are 18+ to compete with each other on the outcome of an activity in which they participate. In peer-to-peer, skill-based gaming, there is no playing against the “house,” removing the house advantage and instead focusing on the same starting conditions for all players who will compete against one another based on their physical or mental ability. Lucra is indifferent to the outcome of the result of the contest and does not receive an entry fee or rake on contests. Unlike sports betting, which is based on the performance of other participants, Lucra’s recreational, skill-based gaming product focuses on the active participation of users based on their physical or mental abilities.

                <li class="faq-box">
                  <h5 class="faq-heading">Do you offer Responsible Gaming Resources? Are there limits to what can be risked?</h5>
                  <p class="read faq-text">
                    Yes, Lucra maintains best-in-class risk management and compliance infrastructure, allowing customers to set limits and exclusions.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Lucra offers self-exclusion and self-limitation options, letting users control their play within the parameters they set for themselves. Additionally, users have the option to limit the funds they deposit into their account over a specified period on Lucra.

                    <br>

                  <h5 class="faq-heading">What is an SDK?</h5>
                  <p class="read faq-text">
                    An SDK, or Software Development Kit, is a set of tools, libraries, and documentation developers use to create software applications for specific platforms, frameworks, or programming languages. An SDK provides a convenient way for developers to interact with and utilize the capabilities of a specific system or platform without having to start from scratch.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li class="faq-box">
                  <h5 class="faq-heading">What platforms do you support? (i.e. iOS, Android, Swift, React Native, UI kits etc.)</h5>
                  <p class="read faq-text">

                <li class="faq-box">
                  <h5 class="faq-heading">Does the SDK include UI components?</h5>
                  <p class="read faq-text">
                    Yes, Lucra offers two types of integrations: <strong>(1)</strong> An API + our UI or <strong>(2)</strong> an API-only solution if you prefer to build the UI yourselves. Lucra’s API + UI integration will blend seamlessly into your app, as the UI is customized to your brand colors and themes.
                  </p>

                <li class="faq-box">
                  <h5 class="faq-heading">How long does a typical integration take?</h5>
                  <p class="read faq-text">
                    A typical integration for Lucra’s out-of-the-box solutions is two weeks. For more custom solutions, Lucra works with  partners to gather requirements and estimate a timeline. Lucra typically owns 80-90% of the upfront work before passing it to partners for integration.

                  <h5 class="faq-heading">What rating will this fall into in the various app stores? Is it gambling?</h5>
                  <p class="read faq-text">
                    The Lucra SDK will fall under the 17+ app store age ratings.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Lucra SDK is NOT considered gambling. Lucra is legally classified as a skill-based game, which means end users compete against each other based on their abilities rather than predominantly relying on chance.
